## How to navigate the IDE
You can revisit the lecture at any time by clicking the "(i)" icon at the top of the page. The code you write in the browser will automatically be saved. Click "Run Tests" or use CMD + ENTER to test your code - you'll be able to advance to the next stage once all of the tests pass!

## Using Keccak-256

Complete the `toHash` function.

You should be able to pass in some data to the function and it should return the `keccak256` hash of that data. Use `EthCrypto.hash.keccak256` ([Documentation](https://github.com/pubkey/eth-crypto#sign)). 
See **Details** to learn more about the `keccak256` hash function.
